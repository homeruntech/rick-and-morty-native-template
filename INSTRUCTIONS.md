# Rick and Morty

## Assignment

Build an application that displays the characters’ profiles of the Rick & Morty sitcom using the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/).

The app should be a React Native application built with React + TypeScript.

You’re free to choose whether to implement standard pagination or infinite scrolling.

You’re free to choose whether to use the REST API or GraphQL API.

You can find the design we expect you to implement [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FXostZn4wrjuNr5W4D5PGA/Rick-and-Morty-(web-responsive)-(Community)?node-id=97%3A196&amp;amp;t=HV2hIQo7VrgnlR1f-1).

The project already has the following scripts set up:

- `android`: Starts the Android app
- `format`: Run code formatter
- `ios`: Starts the iOS app
- `lint`: Run the linter
- `start`: Starts the Metro bundler
- `test`: Run tests
- `typecheck`: Typecheck code with TypeScript

You can use any styling approaches you want to use (e.g., CSS-in-JS, tailwind). You should not use ready-to-use design system libraries (e.g., Tamagui, etc.).

You’re free to select the vendors you consider necessary for the exercise, but be cautious that overcomplicating the implementation might negatively impact the evaluation.

You're free to choose the platform (iOS or Android) on which you want to develop the application. Be careful that this platform will be the one on which we'll evaluate your assignment.

### Heads UP

The project shouldn’t rely on global dependencies. The coding challenge will be considered unsuccessful if the project doesn't compile after installing its dependencies.

If a particular Android SDK should be used instead of the default one (API 35), it should be specified in the README.

The version of Node that should be used to run this project is specified in the `.node-version` file. If you want to use a different version, you should update `.node-version` accordingly.

## Definition of done

The app runs without errors and has all the features shown in the design.

The test and typecheck scripts work without errors.

### Suggestions

We won’t test the app on iPad/tablet environments, so we suggest you focus on the mobile experience.

Find meaningful names for your components, functions, and constants; the easier it is to follow your code and reasoning, the better.

Prefer a declarative and composable coding style, leveraging well-known functional programming paradigms that make your project easy to iterate on.

Utilize modern React techniques and tools, such as hooks and contexts, where applicable. This will enable us to assess your library knowledge more accurately.

We haven't set up lint, format, and test scripts. Consider doing that yourself, given that Code Quality is a scoring metric. =)

### Score

The score will depend on the following evaluation criteria, listed below in alphabetical order:

- Architecture
- Code notes/comments
- Code quality
- Commit message semantic
- Consistent coding style
- Knowledge of React & React Native
- Performance
- Submission time
- Tests
- Extras (e.g., CI/CD, documentation, innovation, tooling, functional programming)

Host your project in a **private** Github repository, then add as collaborators:

- alpalla
- aydncnar
- paolorovella
- sibest19
- tommaso-sebastianelli
- valeriobelli

You can then send us the link via email once the project is ready for review.

For any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us by replying to the email you received from Hazal.

Good luck, may the Force be with you!
